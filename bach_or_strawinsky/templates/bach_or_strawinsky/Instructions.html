    <p>
        In this study, you will be paired randomly and anonymously with another participant. One of you will be
        randomly designated being a "Bach person" and the other will be designated a "Strawinsky person". Prior to making a decision, you will
        learn your role.
    </p>

    <p>
        Both have two choices for an eveningâ€™s entertainment. Each can either go to a Bach concert
         or to a Strawinsky concert. Each person wants to attend the concert of her favorite composer; however, to both it is more important that they go out together than that each see the preferred entertainment.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each of you must independently and simultaneously make a decision. Your payoffs will be determined by both
        choices as shown below:
